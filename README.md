# LangChain
Langchain is a framework that provides great abstraction over many language models.

The lessons are divided into chapters and each chapter has notebooks. Each chapter covers one of the main concepts of LangChain. 
Since we use OpenAI's models, you should sign up at OpenAI's website as developer and either buy some credits or use the free credits.
